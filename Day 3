/*Write C++ program that demonstrates the use of pointers with simple variables. 
The program should:
Declare three integer variables a,b and c. 
Declare three pointer p1,p2 and p3.
Assign the address of a to p1, the address of b to p2 and the address of c to p3.
Use the pointers to assign the value to a,b and c. 
Calculate the sum of a,b and c using the pointer and store the result in a variable sum.
Print the values of a,b,c and sum*/


CODE:-

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a, b, c;
	int *p1, *p2, *p3;
	p1 = &a;
	p2 = &b;
	p3 = &c;
	*p1 = 15;
	*p2 = 20;
	*p3 = 30;
	int sum = *p1 + *p2 + *p3;
	cout<<"Value of a: "<<a<<endl;
	cout<<"Value of b: "<<b<<endl;
	cout<<"Value of c: "<<c<<endl;
	
}
